1. Open the following link and signup for a free api key: http://www.omdbapi.com/
2. Make a page with two fields: name for the movie, year launched
3. Add a button to submit the search query
4. On the click of the button, make the API call and retrieve search results.
5. First, just map a single movie into a HTML element and insert it into a UL element
as an LI element
6. Then, map the entire array into HTML elements using the map function and insert
into UL as LI elements
7. By this point, you'll have a list of movies on your page
8. Now, implement the year launched filter
9. If a value is present in the year launched field, read that value and filter the
movies array for movies that are launched in or after that year
10. Then show the updated list of movies with the year launched filter applied
11. If no movie is found against the name entered by the user, generate a popup in the
center of the screen with an error message. This popup will be closed by a button
present in the popup
12. Lastly, the movie data on the screen must not be lost when the page is refreshed.
For this, store the data in localStorage when the page is being unloaded, and
retrieve the data from localstorage when page is loaded. If no data is present in
localStorage, show a blank list.
